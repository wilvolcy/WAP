                      <p>These interest rates are in effect on approval.</p>
                      <p>Standard Rate for Purchases: <strong> 14.9%. </strong></p>
                      <p>Standard Rate for Balance Transfers1: 14.9%.</p>
                      <p>Standard Rate for Cash Advances2: 19.8%.</p>
                      <p>If you receive a Gold card, your minimum monthly payment for any given billing period is due by 
                          the date specified on the monthly statement for that period. If your minimum monthly payment 
                          for a billing period (the "first" billing period) is not received and remains outstanding by 
                          the due date of the second billing period, your rates will increase to 29.9%. These new rates 
                          will be in effect on the first day of the third billing period.
                        </p>
                        <p>Example: If you miss the minimum payment due date for your December billing period, it’s very important to make your overdue minimum payment by the due date of your January billing period – otherwise your rates will go up starting on the first day in your February billing period.</p>
                        <p>
                                Once the increased rate is in effect, if we receive your minimum monthly payment by the due date for 9 consecutive billing periods, your rates will change back to the Standard Rates that apply to your account as defined above, starting from the first day of the 10th billing period.
